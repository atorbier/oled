I, if not we, missed the days when 'telly' resolution adjustments are a part of servicing/maintenance process techs implements at the service center. At that time, televisions used to have cathode ray tubes and it really is time consuming to carry out. First, you have to find those leaky caps, degauss the crt and comes the adjustments. The patterns generated are channel selctive and cable distributed. Color bars, crosshatch, greyscale, the RCA indian head, etc. Recently, I bought a locally sold oled shield which doesn't do more than upload and display images from a sd or mmc card. I also had a hard time looking for the driver's datasheet on the web, luckily, I thought of mailing some, if not all, of the manufacturers producing oleds using the same driver ic and one of them replied and sent me a copy of the datasheet. Thanks to billow. Although I'm still on the process of learning and experimenting on how to make this oled shield display some text, I managed to alter some parts of the sample code that came with the oled shield and came up with these patterns displaying a simple , not the SMPTE one, color bar pattern and some animation.
